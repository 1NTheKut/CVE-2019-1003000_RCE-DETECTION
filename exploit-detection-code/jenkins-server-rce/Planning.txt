CVE-2019-1003000 Exploit

I. Pre Development Phase
    1. Reading Orange.tw's exploit code, he used his own domain to host the malicious .jar file however there a github repo that embeds the payload within the script. I am going
    to create a malicious domain and host the jar file there and play around with that first. If not, I'll embed the payload in my program
1. Process Command Line Arguments
    a. username
    b. password
    c. url of target (in this it will be localhost with exposed port from shell script)
        i. log in via rest api and confirm that login was successful - first check
        ii. On success of login
    c. Will try to methods and will see which one works
        i. Will either host a domain with a malicious payload (.jar file) that will execute a bash script or powershell script
            a. Save host domain in constant
        ii. Will include the payload directly in the c sharp file
2. Make GET request to Jenkins REST API
    a. Once connection is verified from previous steps, construct the GET the request
        i. Check status of Get request - second check
    b. The jar file should launch a bash script that sends a simple command to the domain hosting the malicious fie
    c. pull file name from web site
        i. wil have a check. if local file name in program equals that file name then the exploit worked and the vulnerability exists
